Project Description 
------------------- 
Project is aimed to collect ECG recording and sent it to cloud platfrom. Visualization of ECG waveform on Mobile application and detection abnormalities is another side of project. For collecting ECG values we have used AD8232 sensor with NodeMCU. We have used Android Studio to built an mobile application and Firebase Realtime Database as cloud platform.
